# AVx
[![Elixir CI](https://github.com/kim-company/avx/actions/workflows/elixir.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/kim-company/avx/actions/workflows/elixir.yml)



Audio/Video Elixir. This is a libav (NIF) backed library for dealing with audio/video files. Takes
a functional approach allowing users to decide which runtime they want to design.

## Installation
I'll publish it at some point if there is interest. For now,

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:avx, github: "kim-company/avx"}
  ]
end
```

Also, you need ffmpeg's libraries on your machine. `pkg-config` is used to find them.

## Features
- [x] demux any audio/video container (mp4, ogg, mkv, ...)
- [x] decode audio files
- [ ] mux streams
- [ ] decode video files (in theory we should already be there, in practise the stream format for videos is not implemented and neither is the Frame "unpacking")

In the future it will support also encoding and muxing, in this order.

The term unpack is used here (probably incorrectly) to denote the action of
copying the packet/frame out of the C world into Elixir.

## Before you start
- It will probably crash your BEAM at some point, as error handling is far from being complete on the C side. It is already pretty stable though.

- NIFs are supposed to return in <1ms, which does not happen for some functions. I still
need to measure the impact and determine the dirty scheduler that should be picked for each
function.

## Usage
Check the tests, but in practice this is the flow for decoding audio from a
multi-track file from file to file in a lazy fashion.

Supports all protocols supported by libav itself (such as RTMP, UDP, HLS, local
files, unix sockets, TCP, UDP, ...).

```elixir
{:ok, demuxer} = Demuxer.new_from_file(input_path)

# Detect available stream and select one (or more)
streams = Demuxer.read_streams(demuxer)
audio_stream = Enum.find(streams, fn stream -> stream.codec_type == :audio end)

# Initialize the decoder. The sample rate, channel and audio format will match
# the one of the input. At this time, the only resampling performed is from
# planar audio to packed (so the data can be processed by Membrane for example, or
# written directly into a file).
decoder = Decoder.new!(audio_stream)
output = File.stream!(output_path, [:raw, :write])

demuxer
|> Demuxer.consume_packets([audio_stream.stream_index])
|> Decoder.decode_raw(decoder)
|> Enum.into(output)
```

I'm currently working on a ThousandIsland Handler that can be used
to create a Demuxer source suitable for streaming setups.

And that's it. Compared to using the `ffmpeg` executable directly, here you have access
to every single packet, which you can re-route, manipulate and process at will.

This library is suitable as standalone or inside the elements of a [membrane](https://github.com/membraneframework)
pipeline for more complex setups (video mixers with dynamic inputs, WebRTC rooms, ...)

## Debugging
This library works with NIFs. When things go wrong, the BEAM exits!
The idea is to run the `mix test` loop inside a debugger, in my case `lldb`.

To do so, we need to set some env variables, accomplished with `. DEBUG.fish` (check cocoa's link below if you shell is bash, or ask some LLM to translate the script ðŸ˜‰).
To run the tests under the debugger, `lldb -- $ERLEXEC $CMD_ARGS test`.

Usually I either let the test crash and then `bt` to have an overview of the stack, `f <frame number>` to select the frame I want to inspect,
the `v <variable name>` to check the contents of the variable. Otherwise put a breakpoint with `br s -l <line number> -f libav.c`.

## Performance
Nothing serious in here for now, but to give an idea:
- M2 pro
- input file size 0.7Gb of ISO5 mp4
- output file size 1.3Gb of raw audio from 1 of the 3 tracks
- test **overall** duration 3.4 secs
- which gives 0.38Gb/s of output throughput
